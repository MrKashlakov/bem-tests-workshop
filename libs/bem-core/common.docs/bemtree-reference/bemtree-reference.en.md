## BEMTREE features

<a name="arch"></a>

### Architecture

BEMTREE templates are processed using the module [bem-xjst](https://bem.info/tools/templating-engines/bemxjst/) extended with logic from the BEMTREE default template â€“ [i-bem.bemtree](https://github.com/bem/bem-core/blob/v2/common.blocks/i-bem/i-bem.bemtree).

BEMTREE-specific logic is implemented at `i-bem.bemtree` template level. This default template defines:

* the set of standard modes and in what order to call them;
* available context fields.

For a detailed description of BEMTREE's architecture, see the corresponding section of [Data templating in bem-core](https://ru.bem.info/technology/bemhtml/current/templating/#bemx_arch) document (currently available in Russian only).

### Support of BEM-XJST templating

BEMTREE is a BEM-XJST template engine. In other words, BEMTREE uses **BEM-XJST syntax** and retains all the features of BEM-XJST template engines, such as:

* binding to the BEM domain;
* declarative templates;
* JavaScript as the template description and execution language;
* restrictions at conventions level.


<a name="basic"></a>

## Key concepts

<a name="template"></a>
### Templating in a nutshell

BEMTREE is a template engine designed to be used in conjunction with the BEMHTML template engine.

BEMHTML converts an input BEM tree into an output HTML document element by element.

The structure of an input BEM tree must be **view**-oriented, so as to avoid the need to change blocks and elements or their order during the HTML tree generation process.

Transforming a BEM tree into such a format is what the BEMTREE technology is all about.



<a name="data"></a>

### Data handling

The BEMTREE technology is architecture-agnostic in its interaction with the back end.

The following two approaches to interacting with data providers are normally used in BEM projects:

* centralized receipt of data;
* receipt of data at BEMTREE block template level.

There are specific aspects to each of these two approaches, and they should be kept in mind when choosing a preferred way of interacting with the back end.


#### Centralized receipt of data

This method involves the use of a separate module that interacts with the back end, the so-called **controller**.

A request from the browser (or some other event) causes the controller to send a request to the back end. It then saves the response received from the back end, e.g. by storing it in a global variable or as a property of a global object.

A BEMTREE block template maps the fields of the global object or the variable to the BEM entities in the resulting BEMJSON.

Thus the template itself contains no evidence of how the data was obtained, much like the controller does not care about its further representation.

Such an approach employs the principle of separation of the controller from data representation. This principle proves particularly useful when:

* the structure and contents of the page are known at the time of its formatting;
* blocks must not be dependent on how data is received (e.g., for use in external projects, libraries, etc.);
* data is obtained from the same few sources, e.g., a single DBMS.

**NB** Please note that the centralized approach to data handling assumes that a data object received from the back end is fully formed by the time a BEMTREE template is applied.


#### Receipt of data within a BEMTREE block template

This approach is appropriate for a block that receives its data from a source that no other block uses. There is no point in having a separate controller, as its functionality would not be applied to any other blocks. A case in point would be any type of widget: a weather forecast widget, counters, new blog posts, currency exchange rate, etc.

The main advantage of this approach is that blocks are then essentially self-contained. They contain logic for both the receipt and representation of data.



<a name="inputdata"></a>

### Input and output data: BEMJSON

BEMTREE is based on JavaScript, so BEMJSON - a JavaScript data structure (object) with a set of extra conventions on the representation of BEM entities - is used as the BEM tree standard format.

BEMJSON is used for input and output data for the BEMTREE template engine. An input BEM tree is a web page skeleton, which gets filled with data element by element when it is processed by the template engine.

An input BEMJSON may consist of the description of a single BEM entity called the **entry point**, which is where the execution of BEM templates starts. Say, we call a BEMTREE template for a `page` block:


```js
BEMTREE.apply({ block: 'page' })
```

Then the BEMTREE template for the entry point BEM entity includes references to other BEM entities, e.g.:


```js
block('page').content()([{ block: 'header' }, { block: 'main' }, ...])
```

As the template is being processed, the template engine will recursively call the referenced BEMTREE templates, e.g..:


```js
block('header').content()([{ block: 'logo' }, { block: 'menu', content: { elem: 'item' }}])
```

Thus the BEM tree of the entire document is built element by element.


<a name="templatebemjson"></a>

### Template, mode and context

**Template**, **mode** and **context** are the core concepts of BEM-XJST and fully apply to BEMTREE.

You can find detailed information about them in the respective sections of the documentation about templating in bem-core:

* Template
* Mode
* Context


<a name="syntax"></a>

### Template syntax

BEMTREE templates are created using BEM-XJST template syntax. In practice this means that all syntactic structures available in BEMHTML templates can be used in BEMTREE templates.

Syntax-wise, BEMTREE differs from BEMHTML in what sets of context fields and standard modes (including helpers) are available.

<a name="standardmoda"></a>

## Standard modes

The default BEMTREE template defines a set of standard modes which specify the default order for processing an input BEM tree (BEMJSON) and generating an output BEMJSON.

Functionality-wise, modes are divided into two classes:

* The **"empty mode"** determines the algorithm for processing the nodes of an input BEMJSON and calling other modes;
* All other modes determine the order in which BEMJSON elements are sequentially generated. Each of the modes is responsible for the generation of a specific fragment of the output BEMJSON tree.

To generate BEMJSON, in each mode an appropriate template (i.e. one whose predicate is evaluated to true in the given context) is chosen and executed. The result of evaluating of the chosen template body is used in the BEMJSON tree fragment (BEM entity) that the current mode is responsible for generating.

This logic imposes the following limitations on templates:

* If a template outputs some data in BEMJSON, its predicate must specify a mode.
* A template predicate cannot specify more than one mode.
* Evaluating a template body must return the object type expected within the current mode.

In the sections that follow, modes are listed in the order in which they follow each other during the processing of an input BEMJSON element.

BEMTREE modes are identical to BEMHTML modes, the only difference being that BEMTREE does not have modes responsible for the generation of HTML element fragments (classes, attributes, etc).

Other than the empty mode, which specifies the algorithm for processing an input BEM tree and calling other modes, there are only two modes that are available in BEM templates:

* the `default` mode, responsible for the generation of a BEM tree element as a whole. It is usually used for replacing a context entity (e.g., for [wrapping a block in another block](#wrappingunit));
* the `content` mode, which describes the content of the current BEM tree element.


<a name="empty_moda"></a>

### The "empty" mode (`""`)

*Template body value type: 'not used'*

The empty (undefined) mode corresponds to the moment when the value of the context field `this._mode` equals an empty string (`""`). This value is set:

* before the input tree traversal begins;
* during the recursive call of the tree traversal procedure in the `default` mode.

The action performed in the empty mode depends on the element type of the context (current) element in the input BEMJSON tree.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Element type</th>
    <th>Action</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>BEM entity</b> (block or element)</td>
    <td>Set values of context service fields (<code>block elem mods elemMods ctx position</code>)
    and call templates in the <code>default</code> mode.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>string/number</th>
    <td>Convert the value to a string and output it to the BEMJSON result buffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Boolean, undefined, null</th>
    <td>Output an empty string to the BEMJSON result buffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>array</th>
    <td>Iterate through the array and call templates recursively in the empty mode.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Defining a template in the empty mode (sub-predicate `mode(this._mode === '')`) only makes sense if it is necessary to override the traversal process for the input tree.

Calling templates in the empty mode (the `apply('')` construction in the template body) is necessary if the one-to-one mapping principle of "input BEM entity - output BEMJSON element" has to be broken - e.g., to generate more than one element per input entity. Such a call is performed automatically when using the `applyCtx` construction.

**See also**:

  * [Wrapping a block in another block](#wrappingunit)

<a name="default"></a>

### default

*Template body value type: 'not used'*

Within the `default` mode, the entire output BEMJSON element corresponding to the input BEM entity is formed.

During the `default` mode execution, the following takes place:

* all other standard modes responsible for different aspects of the BEMJSON element are called;
* the execution results of all modes called are merged into a resulting BEMJSON;
* templates are called recursively for the result of the `content` mode execution.

A template must be defined for the `default` mode (sub-predicate `def()`) when the procedure for generating the output BEMJSON fragment needs to be overridden. As an example, let's create a BEMTREE template for a [page](https://github.com/bem/bem-core/blob/v2/common.blocks/page/page.bemhtml) block from the redefinition level `common.blocks`:

```js
block('page').def()(function() {
    return applyCtx({
        block: this.block,
        title: this.ctx.title,
        head: [{ elem: 'js', url: this.ctx.js }],
        content: {
            block: 'foo',
            content: this.ctx.foo
        }
    });
});
```

Here, the `applyCtx` construction modifies the input data object `this.ctx`. The construction is used for assigning values to different fields of the object during a call in the `default` mode, and then the procedure `apply()` is automatically called to choose and apply a template.

The template generates arbitrary `title` and `head` fields in the context, and their values are then used by the BEMHTML block template.

<a name="content"></a>

### content

* *Template body value type: `BEMJSON`*
* *Default value: `this.ctx.content`*

Within the `content` mode the content of a BEMJSON element is evaluated. This can be an arbitrary BEMJSON (either a string or a number, or a tree of BEM entities). The default value is the value of the `content` field of the context BEM entity (`this.ctx.content`).

A template must be defined in the `content` mode (sub-predicate `content()`) if it is necessary to:

* add content at template engine level for an entity that lacks `content` in the input BEMJSON;
* substitute the content of an entity at template engine level.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Input data</th>
    <th>Template</th>
    <th>Resulting BEMJSON</th>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>
        <pre><code>{
  block: 'b1'
}</code></pre>
    </td>
    <td>
        <pre><code>block('b1').content()({
  block: 'b2'
})</code></pre>
    </td>
    <td><pre><code>{ block: 'b1', content: { block: 'b2' } }</code></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<a name="context_field"></a>

## Context fields

As it runs, the BEMTREE template engine builds a data structure containing information about the BEMJSON node being processed and the state of processing. In addition, several auxiliary functions are available in the context.

During the execution of a template, the context is available as an object denoted by the keyword `this`. It is available from both the predicate and the template body.

The author of a template can define additional fields in the context.

All context fields can be divided into two categories:

* **Context-dependent** fields, whose values vary depending on the node that is being processed and the processing phase.
* **Context-independent** fields, whose values are constant.

**See also**:

  * [Context](https://ru.bem.info/technology/bemhtml/current/templating/#context) (Russian version only)


<a name="contextdependent"></a>

### Context-dependent fields

The default BEMTREE template does not add any context-dependent fields besides those common to BEM-XJST.


<a name="context_independent"></a>

### Context-independent fields

All context-independent fields are grouped within the object `this._` and serve as auxiliary functions used when the template engine is running. The template author can use these functions in both template bodies and predicates.

BEMTREE extends the set of context-independent fields of BEM-XJST with only one method - `this._.doAsync`.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Field</th>
    <th>Value type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
</tr>
    <td><code>this._.doAsync(Function)</code></td>
    <td><code>Function</code></td>
    <td>Asynchronosly executes a function sent as the argument. Usually used for sending asynchronous requests to the back end. The function returns a promise, the resulting object of which contains fields with info about the context BEM entity.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Converting input data into view-oriented format

#### Problem

An input BEM tree must be built for a news feed (a list of posts with information about the author) that is easy to process in terms of BEMHTML templates. This should be a view-oriented tree, i.e. the set and order of the BEM entities should correspond to those of the DOM nodes in the output HTML.

#### Solution

The back end normally handles normalized data (data-oriented format). In the case of a news feed, the format of input data may be as follows:

```js
{
    posts: [ { text: 'post text 1', author: 'login1' },  { text: 'post text 2', author: 'login2' }â€¦ ],
    users:  { 'login1': { userpic: 'URL', name: 'Full Name 1' }, 'login2': { userpic: 'URL', name: 'Full Name 2' } â€¦ },
}
```

The data is presented in normalized form. In the post list only a user ID is shown, and the full user info is contained in the corresponding hash in the user list. One user can be the author of multiple posts.

The view-oriented data format suggests data denormalization, i.e. the display of the post list in such a way whereby each post includes full information about its author, even if the list includes more than one post from the same author. In BEMJSON this format may look like this:

```js
{
    block: 'posts',
    content: [
        {
            block: 'post',
            content: [
                { block: 'userpic', content: 'URL' },
                { block: 'user', content: 'Full Name 1' },
                { elem: 'text', content: 'post text 1' }
            ]
        },
        {
            block: 'post',
            content: [
                { block: 'userpic', content: 'URL' },
                { block: 'user', content: 'Full Name 2' },
                { elem: 'text', content: 'post text 2' }
            ]
        },
        â€¦
    ]
}
```

Let's assume that the source data is saved in the context field `this.ctx.data`. Then the BEMTREE template that does the necessary transformation may look like this:

```js
 block('posts').content()(function() {
    var data = this.ctx.data;

    return data.posts.map(function(post) {
        var user = data.users[post.author];

        return {
            block: 'post',
            content: [
                { block: 'userpic', content: user.userpic },
                { block: 'user', content: user.name },
                { elem: 'text', content: post.text }
            ]
        };
    });
});
```



<a name="inheritage"></a>

### Inheritance

#### Problem

Two different templates are defined for the same BEM entity (`block b1`) at different [redifinition levels](https://bem.info/method/filesystem/#levels). Each of the templates defines its content in the `content` mode.

The content defined at the first level of redefinition should be inherited at the second level, and also some extra content should be added. An analogue of `<xsl:apply-imports/>` is required.

#### Solution

BEMTREE has an analogue of `<xsl:apply-imports/>`. Its implementation is based on the ability to restart the procedure of applying templates to the current context (`apply()`). Therefore it is possible to call the same template that was previously defined for the given context (BEM entities, modes, etc.) or was defined at another level of redefinition.

When evaluating the expression `apply()`, the result obtained by the application of the previously defined template is returned. To avoid an infinite loop, the sub-predicate to check for a flag (e.g., `_myGuard`) must be added. This flag must be set when executing `apply()`.

```js
// the template at the first level of redefinition
block('b1').content()('text1');

// the template at the second level of redefinition
block('b1').match(function() { return !this._myGuard; }).content()(function() {
    return [
        apply({ _myGuard: true }), // get the previous value of content
        'text2'
    ];
});
```

Applying the templates to block `b1` will result in the following BEMJSON:

```js
{ block: 'b1', content: 'text1text2' }
```

As a simpler alternative, you can use the `applyNext` construction. It automatically generates a unique name for the flag to prevent an infinite loop.

```js
block('b1').content()('text1');

block('b1').content()(function() {
    return [
        applyNext(), // get the previous value of content
        'text2'
    ];
});
```

<a name="wrappingunit"></a>

### Wrapping a block in another block

#### Problem

One block (`b-inner`) must be wrapped in another block (`b-wrapper`) during the execution of a template, so that one input block corresponds to two blocks nested inside each other.

#### Solution

When processing the `b-inner` block in a template in the default mode (the entire element generation), one should modify a fragment of the input tree `this.ctx` (the block `b-wrapper` should be added). This involves the use of the `applyCtx()` construction, which assigns `this.ctx` and applies templates in the empty mode.

```js
block('b-inner').def()(function() {
    return applyCtx({ block: 'b-wrapper', content: this.ctx });
});
```

**NB** The `applyCtx()` construction may be used to **replace** a BEM entity in the source tree, if the original content of the block (`this.ctx`) is not used in the argument of `applyCtx()`.

<a name="additionbem"></a>

### Adding BEM entities to a BEM tree

#### Problem

Design a block with rounded corners that will work in all browsers (without using CSS3).

The input BEMJSON may look like this:

```js
{ block: 'box', content: 'text' }
```
The implementation of rounded corners requires adding four extra elements to the block. The final BEM tree should look like this:

```js
{
    block: 'box',
    content: {
        elem: 'left-top',
        content: {
            elem: 'right-top',
            content: {
                elem: 'right-bottom',
                content: {
                    elem: 'left-bottom',
                    content: 'text'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```


#### Solution

The modification of the input BEM tree at BEMTREE level requires writing a template in the `content` mode for the `box` block. The fragment of the input BEM tree is replaced using the `applyCtx()` construction (adding the necessary elements), and the original content is inserted using the `applyNext()` construction.

The BEMHTML template used for this conversion looks like this:

```js
block('box').content()(function() {
    return applyCtx({
        elem: 'left-top',
        content: {
            elem: 'right-top',
            content: {
                elem: 'right-bottom',
                content: {
                    elem: 'left-bottom',
                    content: applyNext()
                }
            }
        }
    });
});
```

**NB** The hash with the variable `ctx._processed` set to `true` is passed to the method `applyCtx` as the first parameter to execute the method in the modified context.

<a name="check_predicate"></a>

### Checking sub-predicates in a specific order

#### Problem

Template sub-predicates should be checked in a certain order, e.g. first the presence of the `this.world` object should be checked in the context, and then the value of the `this.world.answer` field in that object.

#### Solution

Let's make use of the fact that the sub-predicate of a BEMHTML template can be an arbitrary JavaScript expression and can be written in the following form:

```js
match(function() { return this.world && this.world.answer === 42; })
```

This solution has a disadvantage: the expression won't be optimized during compilation, which will have a negative effect on the template processing speed. In the majority of cases, it is possible and necessary to avoid the need for checking sub-predicates in a strictly specific order.

<a name="binding_html"></a>

### Binding HTML elements by ID

#### Problem

For every `input` input block, a pair of HMTL elements `<label>` and `<input>` must be generated, so that the value of the attribute `input@id`is generated automatically, is unique and is equal to the value of the attribute `label@for`.

The input data may look like this:

```js
{
  block: 'input',
  label: 'My Input',
  content: 'my value'
}
```

#### Solution

To generate a unique ID that can serve as the value of the attribute `id`, let's use the auxiliary context function `this.generateId()`. Generating two HTML elements based on a single input block requires a template in the `content` mode that forms the required two elements and their attributes:

```js
block('input')(
  content()(function() {
    return [
        {
          tag: 'label',
          attrs: { 'for': this.generateId() },
          content: this.ctx.label
        },
        {
          tag: 'input',
          attrs: {
            id: this.generateId(),
            value: applyNext()
          }
        }
      ];
  })
);
```

#### Conclusion

When creating BEMTREE templates, the same techniques can be used as are applicable to BEMHTML. So if you've come across an interesting solution in a BEMHTML template, feel free to experiment - it is more than likely that the same solution will work for BEMTREE as well.
