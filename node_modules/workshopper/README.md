**Workshopper** is used by **[learnyounode](https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode)**, and other Node.js command-line workshop applications.

*Documentation is being written for the v1 rewrite right now! Ping @rvagg if you need anything. **learnyounode** is now using this new version, for now you can use it to see how this works.

For now, [@linclark](https://github.com/linclark) has written a good introduction on creating your own workshop, available [here](http://lin-clark.com/blog/2014/07/01/authoring-nodejs-workshopper-lessons/).

## High-level overview

Workshopper is essentially a *test-runner* with a fancy terminal UI. The Workshopper package itself is largely concerned with the menu system and some of the basic command-line parsing. Much of the work for executing the exercise validation is handled by [workshopper-exercise](http://github.com/rvagg/workshopper-exercise).
